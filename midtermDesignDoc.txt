** Midterm Project Design Document **

Project by Catherine Finnegan

1. Purpose: 

The purpose of this program is to illustrate camera movements as well 
as diffused lighting and 3D object animation.

2. Elements: 

There are 5 objects in this scene, excluding the floor;
2 cubes
1 cone
1 torus
1 sphere

The sphere is attached to the torus such that the sphere's orbit is dependent
on the rotation of the torus. The cone and cubes rotate on different axis at 
different speeds. 

3. Actions

There are 8 possible actions by the user using the keyboard that can alter/manipulate
the camera view; 

W - Dolly Forward
S - Dolly Backward
A - Strafe Left
D - Strafe Right
I - Pedestal Up
K - Pedestal Down
J - Pan Left
L - Pan Right

4. Overview

In programming this project I first created the objects I wanted to include using the 
functions simpleObjectLibrary.js program, after which I created the shader programs for 
the objects. Following this I worked on the camera movements, using the material from 
class to program all the functions (such as pan right or pedestal up). The last step was 
the animation of each object.
